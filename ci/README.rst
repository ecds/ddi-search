This directory includes scripts to install and run
exist-db for continuous integration.

Based on http://exist-db.org/exist/apps/wiki/blogs/eXist/travisci
and https://github.com/line-o/travis-existdb


NOTE: ci scripts copied from eulexistdb. Would be better if they
were shared/imported from eulexistdb package rather than duplicated.
