===========

Installation
------------

Instructions to install required software and systems, configure the application,
and run various scripts to load initial data.

Software Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We recommend the use of `pip <http://pip.openplans.org/>`_ and `virtualenv
<http://virtualenv.openplans.org/>`_ for environment and dependency
management in this and other Python projects. If you don't have them
installed, you can get them with ``sudo easy_install pip`` and then
``sudo pip install virtualenv``.

------

Bootstrapping a development environment
---------------------------------------

* Copy ``ddisearch/localsettings.py.dist`` to ``ddisearch/localsettings.py``
  and configure any local settings: **DATABASES**, **EXIST_**, **SECRET_KEY**,
  customize **LOGGING**, etc.
* Create a new virtualenv and activate it.
* Install fabric: ``pip install fabric``
* Use fabric to run a local build, which will install python dependencies in
  your virtualenv, run unit tests, and build sphinx documentation: ``fab build``


Deploy to QA and Production should be done using ``fab deploy``
