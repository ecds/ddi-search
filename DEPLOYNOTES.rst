Installation
------------

Instructions to install required software and systems, configure the application,
and run various scripts to load initial data.

Software Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We recommend the use of `pip <http://pip.openplans.org/>`_ and `virtualenv
<http://virtualenv.openplans.org/>`_ for environment and dependency
management in this and other Python projects. If you don't have them
installed, you can get them with ``sudo easy_install pip`` and then ``sudo pip install
virtualenv``.
