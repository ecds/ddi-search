Search & Browse Functionality
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* As a researcher, I want to search by keyword or phrase across all data collections
  as a simple way to find records that include all of my search terms.
* As a researcher viewing search results, I want to see all dates and date
  ranges associated with a dataset so that I can quickly see what time periods are covered.
* As a researcher viewing search results, I want to be able to re-sort by title
  or date range to find a specific resource or recent studies
* As a researcher viewing search results, I see 10 results per page by default,
  but can choose to view 25, 50, or 100 results so that it doesn't take as long
  to page through a large result set.
* As a researcher viewing search results, I want to see results sorted by relevance
  by default.
* As a researcher I want to view a list of results that includes title, summary,
  keywords, and relevance score so I can better determine which results I want
  to look at in detail.
* As a researcher viewing search results, I want an easy, visual indicator of
  the relevancy of results so that I can make a better judgement about which results to view.
* As a researcher, I want to view partial records from the search results page
  so I can determine records I want to use without leaving the search results page.
* As a researcher searching on multiple criteria, I want to specify terms
  in addition to keywords, for any of the following: title, summary, and/or source,
  so that I can find specific resources.
* As a researcher performing a search, I want to search by geographic location,
  including nation, country, and/or economic entity to tailor results to a specific
  geographic location or groups of locations.
* As a researcher, I want to use use grouping and boolean operators in the keyword
  search input to look for combinations of terms or search for different terms
  for the same concept, in order to find more precise results.
* As a researcher, I want to be able to jump anywhere within the full set of
  search results, so that I can easily get to any of the content.
* As a researcher entering search criteria, I want to be able to reset criteria
  to revert to the default before searching.
* As a researcher performing a search, I want to search by a single date where the
  date coverage includes that date, before or after a given date, or using a date
  range so that I can locate results by a specific time period.
* As a researcher, I want to be able to sort search results by either the beginning
  of the date coverage or the end, so that I can quickly determine which datasets
  have either the earliest coverage or the most recent coverage.
* As a researcher, I want to browse lists of newly purchased data collections so
  I can be aware of them.
* As a researcher, I want search results to be displayed in a way that makes the
  results easy to scan in order to find pertinent information more quickly.
* As a researcher viewing a single record, I want to be able to click on any of
  the associated keywords or topics to find other resources with those terms,
  in order to find related materials.
* As a researcher, I want to browse by topic so I can ensure I search broadly
  enough to find all relevant data.
* As a researcher, I want to be able to search by just date ranges alone, so that
  I can quickly determine what data are available for a particular time period.
* As a researcher, I want to browse by geographic region so I can see all data
  available for groups of countries, in addition to those available for individual
  countries.

Record Display
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* As a researcher, I want to display the full record associated with a search
  result, inc. summary, title, topic, date range, and geography so I can gain a
  comprehensive sense of the data.
* As a researcher viewing a single record, I want to be able to click on any of
  geographical coverage terms to find other resources which also cover those
  locations, in order to find related materials.
* As a researcher viewing a single record, I want to see a map of the locations
  covered by the data, so I can get a visual sense of the geographical coverage.
* As a researcher, when viewing the full record, I will know where to locate the
  data (online or in a physical location) so I can make use of the data.

Data Management
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* As a data services staff member, I need to update and add newly purchased data
  collections to keep things up to date and better advertise the resources available.
* As a data services staff member, when I add or update data collection records,
  I want ICPSR topic headings mapped to a broader set of predefined topics so
  that users can browse by a curated list of topics.
* As a data services staff member, when I add or update data collection records,
  I want time period dates cleaned up so that users can consistently search content by dates.
* As a data services staff member, when I add or update data collection records,
  I want geographical terms categorized or coded, in order to provide users with
  better ways to browse and view datasets geographically.

Theme, branding, etc.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Automated tools, such as search engine robots or site crawlers, can find
  machine-readable site maps for the ICPSR search site content, in order to
  make search engine harvesting of site content more efficient.
* As a researcher, when I attempt to access a page that is absent, I can easily
  reorient myself and seamlessly continue using the site.
* As a researcher, I want to interact with a web design that is elegant and consistent
  throughout the site in order to make the site easier and more enjoyable to use.
* As a researcher, I want to interact with a web design that is responsive in
  order to make the site easier to use on a variety of devices.
* As a user I should see Emory University and ECDS/Data Center branding on the
  site, so that I know that who is responsible for the site and the resources.
